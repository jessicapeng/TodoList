# To Do List

A To Do List application created with React.js. In order to run, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/jessicapeng/TodoList.git`

 and once you are inside the repository, run `npm install` in order to install all the dependencies in the package.json and then run `npm start` to start the app and it will tell you that it has started the application on a server, most likeley on `localhost:3000` so open a browser and paste that in so that you can see the To Do List.
